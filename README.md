# Tokyo Olympic Data Engineering Project 🏅
This project is a personal data engineering and analytics exercise using Python and Pandas. This project aims to recreate the @darshilparmar Tokyo Olympic Data Engineering project using Pandas instead of PySpark.  
The goal is to transform, clean, and analyse the Tokyo 2020 Olympic datasets to generate meaningful insights on medal distribution, gender participation, and national performance.
